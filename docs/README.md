Project Purpose Summary
Agent Coordination Protocol SaaS (ACPaaS) aims to be the definitive infrastructure layer for building complex, multi-agent systems, akin to "Stripe for Agents." It addresses the significant challenge developers face in creating secure, reliable, and interoperable communication protocols for coordinating diverse software agents, especially across different programming languages (initially Python and Ruby) and environments.

By providing a standardized protocol built on WSS with mandatory mTLS authentication, robust session management, reliable message delivery (ACKs, sequencing), and basic flow control, ACPaaS allows developers to focus on agent logic rather than the underlying communication complexities. The platform offers operational visibility through a monitoring dashboard and is designed as a commercial SaaS offering with tiered pricing, enabling seamless development, deployment, and management of sophisticated agent interactions.

**The "Stripe Gateway for Agents": Standardized, Secure, and Reliable Communication for Multi-Agent Systems.**

---

## Overview

ACPaaS provides a cloud-based platform and a well-defined protocol specification to enable robust coordination between diverse software agents. It tackles the common infrastructure challenges of building multi-agent systems:

*   **Secure Authentication:** Mandatory Mutual TLS (mTLS) ensures only authorized agents can communicate.
*   **Reliable Messaging:** Built-in session management, message acknowledgments (ACKs), sequencing, and basic flow control handle unreliable network conditions.
*   **Interoperability:** Standardized JSON messaging over WebSockets Secure (WSS) allows agents written in different languages (initially Python & Ruby) to coordinate effectively.
*   **Simplified Development:** Focus on your agent's logic, not communication plumbing. ACPaaS provides the infrastructure backbone.
*   **Operational Visibility:** A developer dashboard offers insights into agent status and communication metrics.

This repository contains the core backend platform, example agent implementations, documentation, and supporting tools.

## Core Features (MVP)

*   WSS Communication with mandatory mTLS Authentication
*   JSON-based Message Structure
*   Agent Registration and Capability Exchange
*   Logical Session Management (Init, Accept, Reject, Close)
*   Task Request/Response Handling within Sessions
*   Protocol-level Message Acknowledgements (`MESSAGE_ACK`)
*   Message Sequencing within Sessions
*   Basic Flow Control (`PAUSE`/`RESUME`)
*   Structured Error Reporting
*   Python (FastAPI) Backend Platform
*   Example Python Agent Implementation (using `asyncio`, `websockets`)
*   Example Ruby Agent Implementation (using `async`, `async-websocket`)
*   Basic Monitoring Dashboard
*   Backend Hooks for Tiered Billing (Stripe Integration)

## Who is this for?

*   Developers building applications with multiple coordinating agents or microservices.
*   AI/ML teams needing to orchestrate complex workflows across different tools/languages.
*   Companies requiring reliable automation and integration between Python and Ruby components (and potentially other languages in the future).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Python:** 3.8+ (for backend and Python examples)
*   **Ruby:** 2.7+ (for Ruby examples)
*   **OpenSSL:** Command-line tool for certificate generation.
*   **Docker & Docker Compose (Recommended):** For easily running the backend service.
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd acpaas
Use code with caution.
Markdown
2. Setup Authentication (mTLS Certificates)
Every agent (and potentially the backend itself, depending on deployment) needs mTLS certificates signed by a common Certificate Authority (CA).

Follow the instructions in docs/AUTHENTICATION.md to generate your private CA and individual agent certificates using the provided scripts in the scripts/ directory.

# Example: Generate CA (do this once)
bash scripts/generate_ca.sh
# Enter password for CA key when prompted

# Example: Generate certs for 'agente_py'
bash scripts/generate_agent_cert.sh agente_py
# Enter CA password when prompted

# Example: Generate certs for 'agente_ruby'
bash scripts/generate_agent_cert.sh agente_ruby
# Enter CA password when prompted
Use code with caution.
Bash
Ensure the generated ca-cert.pem and the specific <agent_id>-key.pem & <agent_id>-cert.pem files are accessible to the agents/backend at runtime.

3. Run the ACPaaS Backend (Optional - for SaaS simulation)
The backend orchestrates connections, tracks state, and provides the API/dashboard.

(Instructions below assume Docker)

Configure Backend: You might need to adjust settings (like certificate paths if the backend requires its own mTLS identity) in acpaas_backend/app/core/config.py or via environment variables defined in a .env file or docker-compose.yml.

Build & Run:

cd acpaas_backend
docker-compose up --build
# Or: docker build -t acpaas-backend . && docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 443:443 <...> acpaas-backend
Use code with caution.
Bash
Note: The default setup might require mapping ports and volumes for certificates.

Refer to acpaas_backend/README.md (if created) for more detailed backend setup.

4. Run the Example Agents
These examples demonstrate how agents implement the protocol to communicate (either peer-to-peer or via the backend).

Python Agent:

Navigate to examples/python_agent/.

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the agent (adjust arguments as needed):

python agent_py.py \
  --id "agente_py" \
  --port 8765 \
  --peer-uri "wss://<RUBY_AGENT_HOSTNAME_OR_IP>:8766" \ # Target Ruby agent
  --ca-cert ../../ca-cert.pem \      # Adjust path to CA cert
  --my-cert ../../agente_py-cert.pem \ # Adjust path to agent cert
  --my-key ../../agente_py-key.pem   # Adjust path to agent key
Use code with caution.
Bash
See docs/QUICK_START_PYTHON.md for more details.

Ruby Agent:

Navigate to examples/ruby_agent/.

Install dependencies: bundle install

Run the agent (adjust arguments as needed):

ruby agent_rb.rb \
  --id "agente_ruby" \
  --port 8766 \
  --peer-uri "wss://<PYTHON_AGENT_HOSTNAME_OR_IP>:8765" \ # Target Python agent
  --ca-cert ../../ca-cert.pem \      # Adjust path to CA cert
  --my-cert ../../agente_ruby-cert.pem \ # Adjust path to agent cert
  --my-key ../../agente_ruby-key.pem   # Adjust path to agent key
Use code with caution.
Bash
See docs/QUICK_START_RUBY.md for more details.

You should now see the agents connecting, authenticating via mTLS, registering, exchanging capabilities, and potentially initiating sessions/tasks based on the example logic.
